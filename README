This is a python client for the Chimp protocol which is built on top of APE

Right now it only does:

      APE handshaking
      APE channel join
      APE send and receive

Not Chimp-specific stuff is implemented yet.


ToDo:

  Use non-blocking IO to support > 4k receives
  Detecting APE errors and conversion to Python exceptions
  Ensure that ID is really unique (retry on APE nick collision)
